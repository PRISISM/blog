Welcome to my personal website and blog! 

I will mostly be documenting my studies and journey in software development, but you can also expect posts about graphic design, books, video games, or Japanese media. You can check out some personal projects I have completed by clicking the Projects link in the navigation bar! 

If you want to know more about me, you can check out the About page as well, or feel free to send me a message through any of the mediums linked in the footer. 

Thank you for reading,

_Sheldon_
