Hi, I'm Sheldon! Born and raised in Auckland, New Zealand, I'm currently in my third year of my _Bachelor of Science in Computer Science_ at the University of Auckland.

I am always eager to learn and use new technologies. My current programming interests lie in web development and working with mobile applications.

My hobbies outside of programming lie in graphic design, literature, anime/manga and video games. I am also currently operating as Marketing Manager for the University of Auckland Fighting Game Club.
