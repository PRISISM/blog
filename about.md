Hi, I'm Shel! Born and raised in Auckland, New Zealand, I'm currently in my third year of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Auckland.

I am eager to use new technologies and always strive to create accessible software for end users.

My interests outside of programming lie in graphic design, literature, anime/manga and video games.
