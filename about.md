Hi, I'm Shel! Born and raised in Auckland, New Zealand, I'm currently in my third year of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Auckland.

I am interested in creating accessible software for end users and programming efficient solutions for translation purposes. 

When I'm not programming, you can find me usually reading, consuming Japanese media, or playing video games.
